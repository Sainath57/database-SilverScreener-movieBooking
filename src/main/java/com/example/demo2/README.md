### Introduction:
Our project 'SilverScreener' is a Movie Ticket Reservation Platform where one can book tickets for different movies.

In this project we have used concepts called JSP,Servlets, Java, HTML,CSS,JS,Maven Dependencies, MySQL, Apache Tomcat Server for implementation.

Editors such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) IDE can be used for execution.
Also terminal commands can be used to save files and compile them.

Prerequisites:
-> Need to download [Java20](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-windows),[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/),[Apache Tomcat Server](https://tomcat.apache.org)

### Implementation:
There are pre-works that needs to be done before execution of our project. 

Apache Tomcat server module and mysql connector jar file needs to be attached to the project.

In our project there are 2 types of files i.e. .jsp and .java

.jsp files are used for front end and .java files are backend. The file which is the starting point of project is the index.jsp file which is the file we execute to run the project.

As part of this project we have also made UML Class Diagram, performed BCNF Decomposition and 3NF Synthesis Algorithm.

Initially we have made a class diagram based on with we have implemented our project but late it turned out to be redundant.
Therefore, we have changed our database design i.e UML Class Diagram. We are including both the diagrams in the uploaded files.

My team has dome a tremendous work in designing front end, but unfortunately our backend did not work for that UI. But since the time was running low, we have made a different UI and backend to show the changes in our database.
Along the main files, I am also uploading the front-end files which my teammates have done to show their work.
